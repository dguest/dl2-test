DL2 Testing Things
==================

This is a collection of scripts to help develop DL2.

Translating from DL1
--------------------

There's a script called `translate-shlomi.py` which takes one of the
lwtnn input files and translates the input names to the edm standard
using a json file. By default this file is called `mvtm2edm.json`.
